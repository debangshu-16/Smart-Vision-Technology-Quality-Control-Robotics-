# **Smart Vision Technology for Quality Control**
This project aims to revolutionize the quality inspection process for India's largest ecommerce company by leveraging camera vision technology. The system is designed to assess the shipment quality and quantity efficiently using image processing, machine learning, and sensor integration.

## **Project Overview**
The system utilizes advanced Smart Vision Technology to automate quality control processes. By analyzing images of products, it ensures that the products meet predefined standards for quality, quantity, and packaging integrity. This is achieved through a combination of camera vision, OCR, and machine learning models that detect defects, identify labels, and verify product freshness.

### Key Features:
1. Image Acquisition:
  - High-resolution cameras and optimized lighting setups to capture clear images of products on conveyor belts or in inventory.
2. Image Preprocessing:
  - Filters and normalization techniques to enhance the quality of images for further processing.
3. Feature Extraction:
  - Detect and recognize product details using OCR to extract text such as labels, descriptions, and expiration dates.
  - Geometric analysis for defect detection and color/texture analysis for freshness prediction.
4. Classification and Decision-Making:
  - Machine learning models like CNNs and SVMs to classify products and detect quality issues.
  - Deep learning techniques to continuously improve accuracy based on large datasets.
5. Output and Feedback:
  - Real-time product identification and feedback to operators for defective products.
  - Integration with inventory systems for automatic updates.
6. Integration:
  - Automated sorting using robotic arms or conveyors based on quality assessments.
  - Data logging and feedback loops for continuous improvement.
